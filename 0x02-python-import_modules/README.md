Task 0: Write a program that imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3

You have to use print function with string format to display integers
You have to assign:
the value 1 to a variable called a
the value 2 to a variable called b

Task 1: Write a program that imports functions from the file calculator_1.py, does some Maths, and prints the result.

Do not use the function print (with string format to display integers) more than 4 times
You have to define:
the value 10 to a variable a
the value 5 to a variable b

Task 2: Write a program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments.

The output should be:
Number of argument(s) followed by argument (if number is one) or arguments (otherwise), followed by
: (or . if no arguments were passed) followed by
a new line, followed by (if at least one argument),
one line per argument:
the position of the argument (starting at 1) followed by :, followed by the argument value and a new line

Task 3: Write a program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments

The output should be the result of the addition of all arguments, followed by a new line
You can cast arguments into integers by using int() (you can assume that all arguments can be casted into integers)

Task 4: Write a program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module hidden_4.pyc (please download it locally).

Task 5: Write a program that imports the variable a from the file variable_load_5.py and prints its value.

Task 6: Write a program that imports all functions from the file calculator_1.py and handles basic operations.

Usage: ./100-my_calculator.py a operator b
If the number of arguments is not 3, your program has to:
print Usage: ./100-my_calculator.py <a> <operator> <b> followed with a new line

Task 7: Write a program that prints #pythoniscool, followed by a new line, in the standard output.
